# docker-pihole-dote

An up-to-date version of [docker-pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole), with DoTE enabled.

Based on [boostchicken/pihole-dote:latest](https://hub.docker.com/layers/boostchicken/pihole-dote/latest/images/sha256-995c5f26aebcac386f2b5460e606c8f94b0100eccc4879bdb5d76da0fc1b4fee?context=explore), but with DoTE baked into the image, instead of downloaded at launch.
